These are the spin-dependent structure functions of 129Xe and 131Xe, curve traced by Jelle on 11 January 2018 from:
    Figure 11 of https://arxiv.org/pdf/1208.6426.pdf
    Cerdeno et al, Nuclear uncertainties in the spin-dependent structure functions for direct dark matter detection

Black = Mendenez et al (used for XENON100 limit)
Blue = Region from Cerdeno et al, including differences between calculations

The uncertainties on the S00 curve from Mendenez are negligible (according to Cerdeno at least).

For S11 the bottom of the blue curve drops below the figure's limits at u~1.5;
this should be well above the region of interest for any analysis.

As defined in Cerdeno et al:
u = (q b)^2/2
    with q the momentum transfer
    b = "oscillator size parameter" A^(1/6)   [I think A is atomic number, and they forgot to add fm]
